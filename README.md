▶️ How to test it on an LMS
(Example: Moodle)
Log in to Moodle as Teacher or Admin.
Open the course where you want to add the SCORM package.
Turn editing on (“Turn editing on”).
Click “Add an activity or resource”.
Choose “SCORM package” and press Add.
In the Package file section, upload the SCORM_Player_Demo.zip.
Save and return to the course.
Open the activity → the SCORM Player will launch and track your progress.
📝 What gets tracked?
cmi.core.lesson_status → not attempted / incomplete / completed / passed.
cmi.core.score.raw → quiz score (0–100).
cmi.core.lesson_location → last slide you visited.
cmi.suspend_data → extra state (progress, quiz results).
🌍 If you don’t have a course yet
Use SCORM Cloud (free trial at scorm.com
) → just upload the ZIP and test.
Or install Moodle locally with XAMPP or Docker for a personal LMS.
Or simply open index.html in your browser → it will still work with LocalStorage (but without LMS reporting).
